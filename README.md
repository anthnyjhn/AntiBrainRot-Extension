# AntiBrainRot

An Anti-Brainrot Chrome Extension.

## 🚀 Goal

Help people resist social media's retention tricks by suggesting random videos — ones that might catch your attention but that you don't actually need to watch.  
The mission is simple: **consume intentionally, not mindlessly.**

## 🎯 Target Platforms

- YouTube
- Instagram
- TikTok
- Facebook

## 📋 Functions

- ❌ Block access to short-form content.
- 🚫 Hide suggested contents unless they are the result of a user search.
- 🔥 Hide contents that are designed to keep users hooked rather than provide real value.
